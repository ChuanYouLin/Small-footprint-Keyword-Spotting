## Development

This is just a demo project, the main setup to compile kaldi-android
library AAR is available at [vosk-api](http://github.com/alphacep/vosk-api). Check
compilation instructions there as well as development plans.

## Languages

Models for different languages (English, Chinese, Russian) are available in
[Releases](https://github.com/alphacep/kaldi-android-demo/releases) section. To use the model unpack it into
```kaldi-android-demo/models/src/main/assets/sync/model-android```. More languages gonna be ready soon.

## Updating grammar and language model

To run on android model has to be sufficiently small, we recommend to check model sizes in the demo to figure out what should be the size of the model. If you want to update the grammar or the acoustic model, check [vosk-api documentation](https://github.com/alphacep/vosk-api/blob/master/doc/models.md).
